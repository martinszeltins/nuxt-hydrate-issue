[ ] Add GraphQL client
[ ] Split the app into modules
[ ] Figure out how to abstract Apollo GraphQL client
[ ] Try to move everything under common that is not a module :) Nuxt API has config for most things I think.
[ ] nuxt config file is a bit of a mess now, needs organizing, cleanup.
[ ] Generate TypeScript types from GraphQL schema
[ ] Figure out how to add query parameter to graphql endpoint dynamically like ?api=getUsers
[ ] Why is nuxt building the app twice on container start?
